	 <p class="aboutme">Hello! I’m Jesika Wilson.

		I am currently a senior at Illinois State University with a passion for creative work. My courses in the Creative Technologies department have allowed me to experiment 
		within different art mediums, being sound design, photography, digital drawing, and other practices. I am admittedly a beginner at all of these, but have enjoyed being able to learn about each process, as well as discover what I have the most fun with. In the future, I hope to devote more of my personal time to exploring new possibilities with creative technology,  specifically with sound design and film editing.</p>
